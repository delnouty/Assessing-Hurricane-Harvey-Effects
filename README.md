# Assessing Hurricane Harvey effects
> Tropical cyclones have a significant impact on the economy of the region, causing material damage and losses
of life. Using Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology (HLPM) vendors offer various products adapted to
potential losses. It is obvious, that the complex nature of cyclones does not allow applying the same models
and products each year. After each event occurrence HLPM is analyzed and eventually corrected with respect
to a new set of standards. One of the powerful methods used for the standards definition is Probability-Based
Damage Detection. This last requires the initial data preprocessing to point out and analyze the most important
features of the event. In this work, we will concentrate on the Harvey hurricane which took place in August 2017
in the USA. Our primary goal is to analyze the property cost which was declared as damaged due to this event
and to facilitate the assessing effects in the most impacted states.

# Dataset related to Hurricane Harvey
In this study we use the data selected from the data file which contained a list of categorized weather events
(as well as information about damage costs, number of resulting injuries, location, and etc.) that occurred in the
United States in 2017. The events related to Hurricane Harvey occured from 08.17.2017 to 09.01.2017.
